Sofwerx automated intrusion tracking repository

The videos folder has some videos of people, I highly recommend vid2.mp4 (60 fps time lapse in public area)
The moreData folder has images generated by person_detection.py, separated by video/feed
The images folder has ~150 good images of jonathan and petar, which can be used for training


###In order for the person_detection.py script to work, a few things need to be checked.
1. python 2.7 installed
2. tensorflow installed/built
3. opencv installed/build
4. numpy installed
5. pandas installed
6. other dependencies at the top, to be imported, installed

7. Make sure you have the tensorflow models installed and protoc'd, such that you have the directory /tensorflow/models/research/object_detection/
essentially, cd / and then git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
8. the person_detection.py script is in that directory

9. https://github.com/sofwerx/assault-rifle-detection do this, but instead of the longgun_detection.py, use the person_detection.py
10. Inside the tf_files folder, create two folders: save_image and save_threat image
then, you should be able to run the script


how to run:
  `python switch_n_type.py forw 0.5`
    ### the number is the time in seconds, first arg can be either forw or back




# Sofwerx Automated Intrusion Tracking README
## This README is split into sections in the order they were executed during our project
## This was implemented on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 mounted on a vehicle equipped with four brushless DC motors with a wheel attached to each, interfaced with a BLDC motor controller, and a USB camera
